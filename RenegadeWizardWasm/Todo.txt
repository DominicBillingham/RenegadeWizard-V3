mini markup lanuage brief:
I would like a mini markup language that lets me rapidly style strings using a set of tags.
Each tag starts #BluBold with a hastag. Then, multiple tags (each startred with a capital) can be used to style the string (returning a span containing the styled text).
The stylying should be done using tailwind classes.

Examples:

#BluBold this text should be blue # 
<span class="text-blue-500 weight-bold">this text should be blue and bold</span>

#RedIta this text should be red and italic. #BluBold this text should be blue
<span class="text-red-500 italic">this text should be red and italic</span>&space<span class="text-blue-500 weight-bold">this text should be blue and bold</span>



#BluBold
